## Commit Guidelines
- Always use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) syntax for commit messages.
- For commits that only update dependencies, use:  
  `build(deps): updates <dep> to v<version>`

## Pull Request Guidelines
- PR titles should be based on the commit(s) they contain.
- Use the same [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) syntax and guidelines for naming PRs as you do for commits.
- For PRs that only update dependencies, use:  
  `build(deps): updates <dep> to v<version>`
